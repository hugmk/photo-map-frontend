# PhotoMap Frontend

This is the **Angular 21 frontend** for the PhotoMap application, a web app that allows users to upload geotagged photos, view them on an interactive map, and add comments.  

## Features

- User authentication (Login / Register) via JWT
- Upload geotagged photos
- Interactive map with markers for each photo (Google Maps API)
- Click on markers to view photo details
- Add and view comments for each photo

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
